  # Installation
   Clone the repository, install dependencies (npm, inquirer, mysql) then run npm start in your terminal. It may be necessary to seed the database if you don't have one already, and a sample seed is provided. 

  # Usage
   This project lacks the functionality to be very useful in its present state for a proper company (one could simply use a spreadsheed). However, it's a nice way to demonstrate coding knowledge and could certainly be improved upon both visually and functionally, to the point of having it become a very useful application. 

  All that said, here's a video of it functioning! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BIGSTfjKEZpiogZ3Ovv9GtB6M2_q30vG/view?usp=sharing
